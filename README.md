# Javascript-Matching-image-Game
Game Rules:
The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra face image. 
The user needs to click on that extra face image. 
If anything except the correct face is clicked, a message is displayed saying that the game is over. 
If the correct face is clicked, all the currently displayed faces are deleted and a new set of faces is shown at random positions. 
Each time a new set of faces is shown there will be 5 more faces than before, on both the left and the right sides. 
There will always be one extra face shown on the left.
There are 4 parts of this assessment:
Part 1 – developing the web page content without JavaScript:only the instructions and the middle line are visible

Part 2 – generating the left side images:For this stage I added JavaScript code which generates numberOfFaces images on the left side. (There are no right side faces in part 2).

Part 3 – handling the right side:extended the JavaScript code developed in part 2 to handle the right side.

Part 4 – finishing the game:For Part 4 I extended the JavaScript code developed in parts 2 and 3, mainly to handle the events and game logic.
